            Our story began on a classic movie night, lost in a sea of options. We asked, "Why is it so hard to find something great to watch?" So, we built CineFind. We're a team of film buffs and tech geeks on a mission to connect people with the perfect stories. We believe the right movie is out there for everyoneâ€”we just make it easier to find.
